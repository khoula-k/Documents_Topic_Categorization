## Abstract
Document categorization is the process of assigning categories or classes to documents depending on their subject matter to make them easier to manage, search, lter, or analyze. Commonly, document categorization tasks are divided into text and visual classications in therm of data. This research problem concentrated on categorizing documents relaying in the text only. Two supervised baseline
models are used to classify news documents into their ten categories. The documents were vectorized using TF-IDf and the two classier models are logistic regression and support vector machines. The models were tuned using grid search method and evaluated by of accuracy, sensitivity, specicity, F-score and AUC.
